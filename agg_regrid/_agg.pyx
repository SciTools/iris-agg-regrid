    Utilises the sub-pixel accuracy and anti-aliasing capability of the
    Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG) to calculate rasterised weights.

    Renders a single grey-scale (0-255) target cell in the source grid buffer.
    Draws the 4 sided target cell as a straight edged polygon, in a clock-wise
    direction from the top-left-hand-corner, to the top-right-hand-corner, to
    the bottom-right-hand-corner to the bottom-left-hand-corner. 

    The origin of the buffer is the top-left-hand-corner.

    Args:

    * weights:
        The 2d weights buffer is updated in-place.
    * xi:
        The fractional x-coordinates of the target cell corners.
    * yi:
        The fractional y-coordinates of the target cell corners.
